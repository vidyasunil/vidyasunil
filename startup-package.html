							<h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4 mbr-editable-content" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" id="Angel">Angel Investment</h3>
							<p>
								Angel Investment means investment in equity shares of startup companies by investors. Investors who invest in the equity shares of startup companies are called Angel Investors. Angel investors are essentially the well-heeled Individuals/Firms/Companies who used to form a group of investors for investment in startup companies or small entrepreneurs.
							</p>
							<br>

							<h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4 mbr-editable-content" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" id="Tax">Provision oF Angel Tax</h3>
							<p>
								The provision of Angel Investment Tax was introduced by the Finance Ministry in the Union Budget of 2012. Under existing rules, funds raised by an unlisted company through equity issuance are covered under this tax to the extent the amount raised is in excess of the fair market value. Such extra inflow was taxable as "income from other sources" under Section 56(2) of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 (IT Act) and charged the corporate tax rate, resulting in an effective tax of over 30%.
								<br>
								Section 56 of the IT Act, 1961 confers on tax authorities the power to levy excess consideration, more than the fair value, against issue of shares. Section 56 (2) (viib) of the Income Tax Act states:
								<br>
								"Any consideration received by a company (startup) from a resident, against issue of shares, exceeds the fair market value of such shares; such excess consideration is taxable in the hands of the startup, as an income."
								<br>
								Therefore, under Indian tax law, if an Indian company receives share subscription amount from an Indian resident which exceeds the fair value of shares, then the excess amount is taxed as “Income from other sources” under Section 56(2) of the Income-Tax Act and charged the corporate tax rate, resulting in an effective tax of over 30%.
							</p>
							<br>

							<h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4 mbr-editable-content" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Exemption of Angel Tax</h3>
							<p>
								The Central Board of Direct Taxes vide Notification1 dated June 14, 2016 (CBDT Notification) had made the required changes in Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income- Tax Act, 1961 exempting startups raising funds from angel investors.
								<br>
								Thus, in order to get the tax benefit, a startup shall have to obtain a certificate from the Inter-Ministerial board of certification indicating that it is an eligible business. The Government of India had, now as an initiative to promote start ups, scrapped the so-called 'Angel Investment Tax' on investors providing funding to startups.
								<br>
								It may be noted here that for the purpose of this CBDT Notification, "startup" shall mean a company in which the public are not substantially interested and which fulfills the conditions specified in the Notification2 of the Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion ("DIPP"), number G.S.R. 180(E), dated the 17th February, 2016, published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, part II, section 3, sub-section (i), dated the 18th February, 2016.
